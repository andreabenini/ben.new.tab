# ben.new.tab
Custom (New Tab) page plugin for chromium/chrome compatible browsers

This plugin changes the default new tab web page for Chrome/Chromium
compatible browsers.
It relies on one single option free text field where you can just specify
your favorite default homepage when the user presses the new tab button.
It may be a local/static html page or a website too, you can basically
build the page with your favorite technology, this plugin just opens that page.
